# Flutter Clock Challenge (Universal Clock)

Welcome to Flutter Clock!

See [flutter.dev/clock](https://flutter.dev/clock) for how to get started, submission requirements, contest rules, and FAQs.


## Final submission  

For this challenge, I create a digital clock floating on the universe with a black hole as a background. The idea is that time is constantly consumed by the black hole.

For the numbers animations, I used [Flutter animation](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/ui/animations/tutorial),  for the animation of the stars, black hole, and comets I used Flare animations using [Rive](https://rive.app/).
Here's the final submission for the clock challenge:
